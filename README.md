## Authors

## Project Goals
The goal of this project was to build/learn how to make a GUI application using C++ Visual Studios.

## Requirements
- Windows 10 64bit
- .Net Framework
- Visual Studios 2017

## Expected Outputs Below
:exclamation: This project was originally made for personal use and wasn't originally intended for large exposure, therefore the source code will contain bad code, dead code, and variable naming confusion. That said I hope you enjoy the Bot!
