## Project Goals
The goal of this project was to build/learn how to make a GUI application using C++ Visual Studios.

## Requirements
- Windows 10 64bit
- .Net Framework
- Visual Studios 2017

## Expected Outputs Below
:exclamation: This project was originally made for personal use and wasn't intended for large exposure, therefore the source code will contain bad code, dead code, and variable naming confusion. That said I hope you enjoy the Bot!
